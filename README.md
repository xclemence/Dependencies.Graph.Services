# Features
Functional features:
- Assemblies import
- Retrieve assemblies
- Managed partial assembly (assembly not found during analysis)
- Managed Sofware (assembly with a main method)

Technical features:
- Transactions
- Swagger to view REST APIs
- Docker

# Package
This project generates two packages. They are available from the package page.
- docker container for APIs
- NuGet package for DTOs assembly


## docker container 
this image is base on Linux. 

You can start a Dependencies Graph Service container like this:

```
docker run \
    --publish=5001:80 \
    dependencies-graph-api:tag
```
When service is running, you can go to swagger page pour explore services

// TODO Screnshot

## nuget package
This NuGet contains an assembly with all Data transfer objects (DTO). These classes are Plain Old C# Object (POCO) and no other dependencies.
This package support Net Standard 2.1.

You can install nuget package like this:

```
dotnet add package Dependencies.Graph.Dtos
```

# Database schema
The database schema is very simple 
- Nodes
-- Assembly: represents an assembly version (assembly full name is used as a key)
-- Software: Additional label for assembly with a main method
-- Partial: an additional label for assembly not found during dependencies analyses (missing assembly or another version is used when program use assembly)
-Relation
-- Reference: represents a reference between two assemblies
// TODO Diagram


# Development
This project has tooling for Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.
